                <h1>Alexander King (literally A King)</h1>
                <p><a href="https://www.literallyaking.com/" target="_blank">Alexander King</a> is an accomplished game designer and educator who has taught at the NYU Game Center since 2017, becoming a core adjunct faculty who sparks a light in every classroom he touches. He is passionate about procedural emergence, system design, and game economies. This passion and his own creativity translating complex systems in fun and unique ways really allows for students to blossom creatively, even if something is seemingly challenging.</p>

                <p>Alexander teaches at NYU unique classes of his own design that could not be found at any other game design program, and which take advantage of his own idiosyncratic interests and background in finance. He creates spaces for learning practical knowledge about highly technical tools and concepts while also offering playful opportunities for artistic creation and critical thinking. Here are two examples of the courses he teaches:

                        <p class="textright">Students learn about modeling in-game economies, balancing, incentives and game theory. The course is designed to empower designers with backgrounds in arts or humanities with a core understanding of Economics that they can apply to their work.</p>

                <h1>Philosophy</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>He is a strong proponent of ungrading. Instead of dealing out lettered grades, he has students fill out forms after every major assignment, talking through what they learned, what could be better, and what grade they are giving themselves. In addition to practicing ungrading in his classes, he frequently talks and <a href="https://www.literallyaking.com/blog"  target="_blank">writes</a> about it and has convinced several other Game Center professors to adopt it.<br>
                    A student on ungrading: “success feels particularly meaningful if you’re challenged [...] and unlike the other classes this feels like one where I can actually learn without fear of failing simply because I’m not as good at coding as others.”</li>
                    <li>When asked about what he likes the most about teaching, he responded “seeing people come up with cool ideas I would never think of myself, or seeing someone do something they didn't think they could do or didn't think they'd like doing”.</li>
                    <li>Alexander emphasizes iterative and collaborative projects, learning by doing and experimentation, and catering to different learning styles using a mixture of exercises, discussion, lecture, and live coding.</li>

                <p><span class="italic">“​​More than the excellent choices in readings, wonderful and demonstrative exercises, and thoughtfully designed workbooks-- an Alexander King class is a warm reminder of what academia should be: an inviting and safe environment where you learn a lot and you want to learn even more.”</span> - Nico Ailani, first year MFA student.

                    <span class="italic">“I took his spreadsheets for game designers class, something I was both excited and nervous to take, but his clear tutorials and very open space for asking questions was deeply comforting and helpful. He engages thoughtfully with all student work, finding meaningful threads to comment on even when a student feels unconfident in their work. In the wake of the recent election, he dedicated a chunk of class to talking through our feelings, and his own thoughts about how community and workers unions (of which he is an active member of), will help us get through.”</span> - Anonymous.

                <h1>Extended example: </h1>
                <p>For his "Economics for Game Designers" class, Alexander King cleverly constructed a comprehensive online hub for the course entirely in Google Sheets, his signature design tool and the most important software to both of his courses. All of the class readings, schedules, instructions, and project submissions take place directly in Google Sheets.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine a mathematics seminar conveyed entirely in the language of proofs. Or, what if you imagine a film workshop where every class is on camera? Alexander King combines the subject and the medium of his pedagogy with elegance that sparks the student's imagination while subtly cultivating their confidence with the tools.
                    <br><br>
                    The dedication to detail with which he architected this class resource cannot be understated. This spreadsheet spans sixteen color-coded tabs: a magenta class directory, two yellow software resource sections, three green tabs for the schedule, the reading list, and an annoted list of further readings and helpful tutorials, and ten for the ten assignment deliverables (arranged from earliest to latest due date). Each of these is meticulously hyperlinked to sub-sheets and folders for sharing work between peers, commenting on readings, reading his feedback, and more. It is just as much a work of art as it is a class hub.

                    <li>He makes beautiful, playful, and easy-to-navigate living websites for all of his classes with all of the info that a student might need, so one never feels lost about when an assignment is due or what materials they missed.</li>
                    <li>He offers thoughtful written feedback on these assignments in which he always emphasizes which parts made him curious or excited, and what parts he would like to see more of.</li>
                    <li>Once a student, always a peer: he never fails to check in with past students he meets in the hallway on what they’re up to now, and he keeps a mailing list to send any job or other opportunity that might suit what past students have learnt in his classes. From a student: “he is very engaged in local arts communities, and his sharing of events [...] have allowed me to meet cool people I wouldn't have otherwise.”</li>

                <h1>Final Statement</h1>
                <p>This committee agrees that Alexander King, through his mentorship, supportiveness, philosophy of education, and dedication, has become a true icon of the department. Among those of us who have had the privilege of being his students, we agree that Spreadsheets and Economics for Game Designers are some of the most exciting and inspiring classes available at the Game Center.<br><br>

                    He offers a classroom full of surprises that transforms some of the most daunting, technical content at the Game Center into pure, joyful artistic communion. His lesson plans are both effective at teaching that hard technical material AND at facilitating comradery between artists with the common goal of understanding their medium more deeply. Even for the students who aren't as comfortable with experimentation, he makes space for a more expansive creativity.<br><br>
                    
                    Through his own art outside the classroom and through his role as an educator that the cold tools of systems design, economies and spreadsheets and formulae and office software, can be bent into expressive mediums full of beautiful meanings.<br><br>
                    
                    We all love Alexander King not only for his visionary and prolific work in shaping the unique classes that he teaches and shares with us, but for his holistic, empathetic and compassionate approach to teaching that humanizes our shared experience as students ■
