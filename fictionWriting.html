        <h4>01.11.2025 -- world of courtyards</h4>
		ever since everything had become courtyards, i couldn't find my way home.
        <br>
        i saw a person dressed as a gardener and carrying a burlap bag of compost.
        <br>
        i decided to follow them.
        <br>
        the gardener passed through many fence gates, which were locked. each time, they pulled a heavy keyring with hundreds of keys attached. they always knew wwhich one to use straight away.
        <br>
        eventually, i became too tired to continue walking. the fog was thickening and it made my eyes water.
        <br>
        the gardener looked at me with a strange, sad expression. "you can't give up now. you need to carry on my burden." he handed me the bag of compost.
        <br>
        i didn't know how to say no without coming across as selfish, so i laid down and i faced the sky. the fog became even denser.
        <br>
        i'm not sure how much time had passed, but at some point, i felt the gardener's presence was gone.
        <br>
        i sat up and i saw that i was sitting in a beautiful field.
