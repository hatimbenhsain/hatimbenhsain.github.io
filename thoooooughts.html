		<h3>25/01/2025 - exhibitionism</h3>
		<p>
			every now and then when i am very sad i get the urge to post on social medial laments like "i'm going to be alone forever so what's the fucking point".
			<br>
			i wonder why? is it a sort of cry for help? desire to get people to comfort me or something?
			<br>
			i end up not posting it because it feels really cringe.
		</p>
		<h3>22/10/2024 - feeling disgusted</h3>
		<p>
			angry and frustrated.
			<br><br>
			working on a presentation about plundercore and in my research stumbled upon this presentation made by this guy and got sucked into reading it and some of his other content and i feel like everything fucking revolves around him and i'm sick of thinking about some guy who barely gives me the time of day. everywhere i go i see him there in the face of my friends in my favorite neighborhood in my fucking bed i'm jealous that he just gets to leave and forget about it while i'm stuck here with his ghost. not that there's really anywhere else i would rather be
			<br><br>
			in my mind there is a reason why i am stuck on him and it feels like fate and we are meant to be but i also rationally do not believe in fate and know this may just be a delusion and part of a history of me being hopelessly attracted to unreachable men and as i type this shit i want to throw up and hurt somebody. why did he like me? why can't i forget about him? why can't i be fine on my own? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? why can't i be happy? 
			<br><br>
			he found my thesis diary the other day so i guess that's also fucking gone in terms of having something uncontaminated by him (who am i kidding i was already writing about him) so now i guess i gotta retreat back in here to write about him. i guess he could find this too. also after seeing one of my non-friends classmates talking about my devlog i realized i probably need to tone that thing down a little bit for the sake of my classmates not thinking i'm insane. still why am i writing this here and like this? i could just put this in a notebook or a note app. maybe i need the artificial validation of putting something out there => feeling productive to actually go through the effort of putting thoughts out. i should change the url to something less obvious like "thooooooughts". but it's stupid someone could still just see this on my github repo. but i don't actually want to hide this. i don't know what i fucking wantttttttt
			<br><br>
			refreshing the page realizing i changed the url and checking if my text looks nice and aligned in a pretty way. everything is manufactured. i wish i could've come up with something for my mini-lesson that is fully mine. i feel like i'm pretending to be someone else, pretending to be part of something all the time. i'm gonna go draw myself in my bathroom mirror.
			<br><br>
			a little bit annoyed because i left my sketchbook at school and had to draw in the notebook i got as a gift from my friend who i hated for half a year. while drawing, i was thinking: i wish i could've come up with something that is more "me" for my presentation. i'm jealous that he's got his own thing going on with plunderludics etc. and i don't know what the fuck my thing is. i feel like i just latch on to whatever seems cool or what people i think are cool like. all my games that aren't plundercore are basically undertale/anthology of the killer/rain world but not as good. what the fuck am i!!!!!!!! a lot of protesting thoughts are coming up in my head which is good but i'll restrain from writing those down rn cause there is probably some value in getting this negativity out. FUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i need to get laid

		<h3>13/09/2024 - colonial mentality</h3>
		<p>
			today something shitty happened in class. it made me strongly aware of my feelings of isolation in the US/new york/the game center/abroad/anywhere.
			<br><br>
			we were discussing our paulo freire reading and i started talking about how his passage on colonial mentality resonated with me. i spoke on how strongly it has prevaded the way i was brought up and infected my mind, and that despite all the unlearning i'd been doing over the past few years, there is still something that seems to me scary and unattainable about the white/westerner, something that they have inherently that i will always be lacking. i also spoke on how reading this made me feel guilty because i feel like i am part of the problem, as someone who feels that i have abandoned my (oppressed) community (morocco/moroccans) for the sake of cozying up and imitating the oppressor (white people/america). as i said all this i felt my voice wavering and got a bit emotional.
			<br><br>
			two of my classmates (white, american) replied. the tl;dr was them connecting the feelings i described to the reading and saying that i shouldn't have to feel guilty for what i just described and that i am already doing the work of unlearning. nothing that they said was really wrong,  but it made me feel terrible, like i was being taught how to accept myself by the very type of person (white, american) who had caused me to not do so, like i didn't already know everything that they had said, like i needed to be comforted and coddled and taken care of. this in front of ~10 other people in the classroom. still, that wasn't so bad. it felt very awkward and surreal, but the moment passed and i forgot about it. but after class, one of those two people came up to me and asked: am i okay? it seemed like i was really emotional earlier. did i need anything? this made me feel a lot worse, as i began to realize how distressed i had seemed to them, and this made me feel very embarassed.
			<br><br>
			again, i don't think my friends did something terribly wrong. they were both well-meaning and the things they said weren't untrue. i felt mostly okay about it, until i was walking home and thinking about it and started crying over the incident. or maybe not over the incident itself, but over a sudden hyper-awareness of how isolated i have been feeling. i've spoken before here about my feelings about not belonging/fitting in. whenever i spend time with americans, i feel like there's this invisible barrier between us, especially when i am surrounded by them, this feeling like they all grew up together and i didn't and i'll never really get them/they'll never really get me. it drives me insane how much i know about americans and their culture and politics and history and whatnot and how little they know about mine. at the same time i am often unwilling to talk about it everytime i get asked about it: because of this strange disparity i just described, and because i don't want to feel like i stand out, like i'm some weird fascinating exotic creature -- but it's also so difficult, how can i describe what's always been the mundane to me? how can i tell you about the place where i grew up when it had been all i had known for most of my life?*
			<br><br>
			i related a lot to this part of the reading where an african author describes hating the colonizer, but also can't help but feeling irrational admiration and obsession towards them. this is anothere thing that gets in the way of my friendship with westerners/americans. after spending so much time idealizing them and being envious of them, it feels impossible to consider as true, equal comrades. this is hard to digest for me and it makes me sad. i love my white american friends and i wish i could spend time with them without this uncomfortable disconnected feeling creeping up every now and then. at the same time, i think i would feel okay not having white american friends or not being close to them. i've had a few people in my life with whom i shared a similar feeling of unbelonging-ness and amongst whom i could truly feel like myself, but they have been few and it's been very difficult to meet more of them since college. i miss those friends very much.
			<br><br>
			i think this specific un-belonging feeling is something that i have tried for quite some time now to represent in my art. i think i will be very happy when i do manage to, especially if it reaches other people who relate to it. i hope it can also help me visualize it more for those for whom it is more difficult to understand/to whom i don't really want to explain it. i think it feels difficult to make because there are so many pieces out there about it through a homesickness lens and that this isn't really about that (or perhaps it is about longing for a non-existing home). i don't want it to come across as some weird superiority "i'm better than everyone else and i will never be understood" complex (especially since i realize a lot of my lack of understanding with my peers comes from my own unwillingness to explain my plight). and i don't want it to be cheesy. i don't want to make another fucking "cooking things from my culture" game**.
			<br><br>
			additional note:
			<br>
			i have a few friends, fellow internationals, who seem to not struggle as much with these "fitting in" issues. These people seem to have no trouble rubbing shoulders with white people and having genuine, fulfilling connections with them, but these people also usually tend to be more strongly connected to their own cultures. i guess then that what this points to is that my feelings of not fitting in here is more strongly connected to my initial feelings of not fitting in growing up in my home and those carrying over to my adulthood rather than it being solely "i am from here, you are from there". This brings me a bit of comfort for some reason.
			<br><br>
			*: i do however feel usually more comfortable approaching the topic with people from other backgrounds that i am less familiar with. this feels nicer and more equal.
			<br><br>
			**: i've been really obsessed with this joke lately that "we need the venba for italian people from queens" and i really feel like there's something there to be exploited but i also don't want to come across as if i'm hating on my fellow POCs for making something nice and genuine about their culture.

		<h3>31/08/2024 - art will save me</h3>
		<p>
			there is part of me that is convinced that art will save me. it happens often that when i feel completely depressed i get this urge to make art, with the genuine belief or perhaps intuition that if i just make the right piece that expresses the way i feel perfectly well and does so in a beautiful way and that people see it and recognize it and my pain and my talent, then i will be healed.
			<br><br>
			it's not a terrible thing that i do this. sometimes the work i make in this state is actually good. more often it's rubbish. but still, at least i'm doing something instead of just sitting around feeling shitty like i tend to more often. practice is always good. i usually feel a bit better afterwards than before (though rarely as good as i imagine this could make me) which i guess should be the point.
			<br><br>
			still, i don't know where that belief/intuition comes from, and i don't know if it's a good thing to believe overall. it sure does motivate me but it might cause me more sorrow (that i'll never make it, that i could if i just worked harder, that i am so close to doing it but keep missing the mark) than is healthy.
			<br><br><br>
			journaling or writing is i guess kind of similar but more straightforward. the element of "people will see this and make me feel good" should be gone but i guess i kind of invite it back in by writing this publically. there is a big part of me that wishes the person that i am in love with will read this and that he will feel so bad for me and/or be so charmed by my romantic deep and tortured soul that he'll come back to me. it's a terrible belief that makes me feel pathetic everytime i visualize it. i keep thinking about adding an icon on my homepage that leads to here but that might just be a proof/symbol of my vanity/neediness. going back to the idea of perhaps having it on there but also hiding it behind several layers somehow. learn everything about me but work for it. maybe you can see it if you light up the right combinations of letters?
			<br><br><br>
			the way i add dashes to every vague concept i introduce just reminded me of the way the AI/dominion characters talk in the Hickman/Gillen Krakoa X-Men comics. it feels right.
			<br><br><br>
			i keep stopping myself from meandering too muck and thinking about not making these too long and separating them into themed sections esp when i think of certain other people's pages and how they are so neat and well-done. but that would be stupid. a first-year told me the other day that i have excellent comedic timing. it made me feel really good.
		</p>

		<h3>27/08/2024 - on the "thought world" and personal things</h3>
		<p>
			some of my friends call pages like this one their "thought world". something about that term makes me cringe a little bit. i prefer to call mine something like "thoughts page". i think this would need to be organized in a way where the thoughts can be explored non linearly, like on a globe, or to have the thoughts of many different people for me to be able to call it a "world".
			<br><br>
			this might also just be a sign to my mysterious repulsion from belonging or acting like a belong to a group. they use it, but they're very few people linked together that use it, so if i use it i am or i am acting like i am part of them, and i don't really feel like i am. i'm also generally really irritable about the smallest things.
			<br><br><br>
			i recently edited the first thought here because it had a list of things that i could write about that i deemed too personal to share here and not really useful anyway. it feels better for me to just write about whatever comes up anyway. i think i'm going to approach this thing a bit differently than initially planned. at least a bit less personal if it seems futile. 
			<br><br>
			i also edited it to remove the mention of someone about whom it's currently painful for me to think about and i didn't want to see it on my own website. is this useful to share? it feels honest and real. i might write more about these feelings.

		<h3>25/08/2024 - a few random questions about games and stray thoughts</h3>
		<p>
			is it low brow to say a game is not fun?
			<br><br>
			everytime i feel about to state that, i feel years of discourse and reading and talking about games that don't need to be fun (i should know i've made a bunch), about "meeting games on their own terms", and about challenging my notions of what is fun for me and other people. i often feel scared about stating this in certain spaces so as not to seem immature/pedantic/mean/stupid. but sometimes i just don't derive any pleasure from something, and i don't really like that.
			<br>
			what made me think of this is some of droqen's droqever games.  i don't rly like them. but i feel like i should to be smart/interesting/cool.
			<br><br>
			i've been writing a draft of a syllabus for a "can games change the world?" class. this has given me the space to formulate a lot of thoughts and questions. one of them that just came up is why do games make you fight evil people (CEOs, politicians, etc.)? is the author trying to get you to feel empowered to defeat them IRL, or is it just shorthand to get you to feel invested in the story? if the former, does it ever work? can we prove it?
			<br>
			i guess the answers to these might be obvious, and a lot of people have written a lot about this i'm sure. but still sometimes i write a villain like this and i rarely stop to think "why do i do this?". maybe it's all virtue signalling. i'd like to hope it's not.
			<br><br>
			saving this document and refreshing the web page to see it in the font and everything feels very satisfying.
			<br><br>
			"b-games" get so much mileage from the player's willingness to keep going just to "see if anything happens if i do this for long enough/if i do this seemingly impossible or not-planned-for thing". when that gets rewarded, it is wonderful. when the player gives up before seeing the surprise, it is unfortunate. when the player goes through the thing and finds nothing new, it is disappointing. the classic "is there anything after this" problem.
			<br>
			i guess this is born from necessity/small authors not having the resources to make things always clear and intuitive as is expected because of AAA/indie-A standards. i guess this also transformed into intentional aesthetic decisions based on an appreciation of the moment of discovery over anything else and an appreciation of the hostile/cold/unresponsive/unfeeling. sometimes it's too much for me but sometimes it's wonderful. the difference can depend on 10 more seconds of gameplay that i decided to give the game when i might've given up. if my friend made the game, i may or may not be willing to give it more lenience.
			<br><br>
			i have noticed when i write freely i use so many ///. this is a sign of my appreciation of the multiple nature of every living/non-living thing.

		<h3>10/06/2024 - beginning</h3>
		<p>
			Thought I'd start laying some thoughts down after being inspired by <a href="https://billwurtz.com/">bill wurtz</a> and <a href="https://newforum.droqen.com/?hidden=true/">droqen</a> (maybe I should also have my own forum? That feels like a step a bit too far in terms of efforts tbh but I do really love the idea).
			<br><br>
			Why do it this way (publically)?  To be honest there's a somewhat perverse/exhibitionist pleasure about the thought of having my personal thoughts out in the open like this (but also with some degree of effort to find by tucking it away in my website) which would I think motivate me to write more and more often (I've picked up journaling on and off over the years and it just never takes... I'll probably drop this eventually too but I think that's an OK thing to happen.) It'd be a bit similar to the kind of things I got out of the <a href="https://hatimb00.itch.io/the-game-of-theseus">the game of theseus</a> (which I should get back into making this summer) but without the constraint of you know having an arc and making it like fictionalized. I also really enjoy being able to access some of my favorites artists' personal writings (see above) and maybe some other people who like my work can find this too and get some value out of it.
			<br><br>
			Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format because US hegemony etc etc.
			<br><br>
			Things to discuss later: my plans for this summer, a new direction for the game of theseus, thesis thoughts, loneliness and crushes, hunger, my relationship with the US, community, (not) being a digital nomad, NYC, why I don't like playing video games.
			<br><br>
			EDIT (25/08/24): I have censored part of this update because it reminded me too much of a specific person and that embarasses me.
