		<h3>10/06/2024 - beginning</h3>
		<p>
			Thought I'd start laying some thoughts down after being inspired by <a href="https://billwurtz.com/">bill wurtz</a> and <a href="https://newforum.droqen.com/?hidden=true/">droqen</a> (maybe I should also have my own forum? That feels like a step a bit too far in terms of efforts tbh but I do really love the idea).
			<br><br>
			Why do it this way (publically)?  To be honest there's a somewhat perverse/exhibitionist pleasure about the thought of having my personal thoughts out in the open like this (but also with some degree of effort to find by tucking it away in my website) which would I think motivate me to write more and more often (I've picked up journaling on and off over the years and it just never takes... I'll probably drop this eventually too but I think that's an OK thing to happen.) It'd be a bit similar to the kind of things I got out of the <a href="https://hatimb00.itch.io/the-game-of-theseus">the game of theseus</a> (which I should get back into making this summer) but without the constraint of you know having an arc and making it like fictionalized. I also really enjoy being able to access some of my favorites artists' personal writings (see above) and maybe some other people who like my work can find this too and get some value out of it.
			<br><br>
			Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format because US hegemony etc etc.
			<br><br>
			Things to discuss later: my plans for this summer, a new direction for the game of theseus, thesis thoughts, loneliness and crushes, hunger, my relationship with the US, community, (not) being a digital nomad, NYC, why I don't like playing video games.
			<br><br>
			EDIT (25/08/24): I have censored part of this update because it reminded me too much of a specific person and that embarasses me.

		<h3>25/08/2024 - a few random questions about games and stray thoughts</h3>
		<p>
			is it low brow to say a game is not fun?
			<br><br>
			everytime i feel about to state that, i feel years of discourse and reading and talking about games that don't need to be fun (i should know i've made a bunch), about "meeting games on their own terms", and about challenging my notions of what is fun for me and other people. i often feel scared about stating this in certain spaces so as not to seem immature/pedantic/mean/stupid. but sometimes i just don't derive any pleasure from something, and i don't really like that.
			<br>
			what made me think of this is some of droqen's droqever games.  i don't rly like them. but i feel like i should to be smart/interesting/cool.
			<br><br>
			i've been writing a draft of a syllabus for a "can games change the world?" class. this has given me the space to formulate a lot of thoughts and questions. one of them that just came up is why do games make you fight evil people (CEOs, politicians, etc.)? is the author trying to get you to feel empowered to defeat them IRL, or is it just shorthand to get you to feel invested in the story? if the former, does it ever work? can we prove it?
			<br>
			i guess the answers to these might be obvious, and a lot of people have written a lot about this i'm sure. but still sometimes i write a villain like this and i rarely stop to think "why do i do this?". maybe it's all virtue signalling. i'd like to hope it's not.
			<br><br>
			saving this document and refreshing the web page to see it in the font and everything feels very satisfying.
			<br><br>
			"b-games" get so much mileage from the player's willingness to keep going just to "see if anything happens if i do this for long enough/if i do this seemingly impossible or not-planned-for thing". when that gets rewarded, it is wonderful. when the player gives up before seeing the surprise, it is unfortunate. when the player goes through the thing and finds nothing new, it is disappointing.
			<br>
			i guess this is born from necessity/small authors not having the resources to make things always clear and intuitive as is expected because of AAA/indie-A standards. i guess this also transformed into intentional aesthetic decisions based on an appreciation of the moment of discovery over anything else and an appreciation of the hostile/cold/unresponsive/unfeeling. sometimes it's too much for me but sometimes it's wonderful. the difference can depend on 10 more seconds of gameplay that i decided to give the game when i might've given up. if my friend made the game, i may or may not be willing to give it more lenience.
			<br><br>
			i have noticed when i write freely i use so many ///. this is a sign of my appreciation of the multiple nature of every living/non-living thing.
