		<h4>31/08/2024 - art will save me</h3>
		<p>
			there is part of me that is convinced that art will save me. it happens often that when i feel completely depressed i get this urge to make art, with the genuine belief or perhaps intuition that if i just make the right piece that expresses the way i feel perfectly well and does so in a beautiful way and that people see it and recognize it and my pain and my talent, then i will be healed.
			<br><br>
			it's not a terrible thing that i do this. sometimes the work i make in this state is actually good. more often it's rubbish. but still, at least i'm doing something instead of just sitting around feeling shitty like i tend to more often. practice is always good. i usually feel a bit better afterwards than before (though rarely as good as i imagine this could make me) which i guess should be the point.
			<br><br>
			still, i don't know where that belief/intuition comes from, and i don't know if it's a good thing to believe overall. it sure does motivate me but it might cause me more sorrow (that i'll never make it, that i could if i just worked harder, that i am so close to doing it but keep missing the mark) than is healthy.
			<br><br><br>
			journaling or writing is i guess kind of similar but more straightforward. the element of "people will see this and make me feel good" should be gone but i guess i kind of invite it back in by writing this publically. there is a big part of me that wishes the person that i am in love with will read this and that he will feel so bad for me and/or be so charmed by my romantic deep and tortured soul that he'll come back to me. it's a terrible belief that makes me feel pathetic everytime i visualize it. i keep thinking about adding an icon on my homepage that leads to here but that might just be a proof/symbol of my vanity/neediness. going back to the idea of perhaps having it on there but also hiding it behind several layers somehow. learn everything about me but work for it. maybe you can see it if you light up the right combinations of letters?
			<br><br><br>
			the way i add dashes to every vague concept i introduce just reminded me of the way the AI/dominion characters talk in the Hickman/Gillen Krakoa X-Men comics. it feels right.
			<br><br><br>
			i keep stopping myself from meandering too muck and thinking about not making these too long and separating them into themed sections esp when i think of certain other people's pages and how they are so neat and well-done. but that would be stupid. a first-year told me the other day that i have excellent comedic timing. it made me feel really good.

		<h3>27/08/2024 - on the "thought world" and personal things</h3>
		<p>
			some of my friends call pages like this one their "thought world". something about that term makes me cringe a little bit. i prefer to call mine something like "thoughts page". i think this would need to be organized in a way where the thoughts can be explored non linearly, like on a globe, or to have the thoughts of many different people for me to be able to call it a "world".
			<br><br>
			this might also just be a sign to my mysterious repulsion from belonging or acting like a belong to a group. they use it, but they're very few people linked together that use it, so if i use it i am or i am acting like i am part of them, and i don't really feel like i am. i'm also generally really irritable about the smallest things.
			<br><br><br>
			i recently edited the first thought here because it had a list of things that i could write about that i deemed too personal to share here and not really useful anyway. it feels better for me to just write about whatever comes up anyway. i think i'm going to approach this thing a bit differently than initially planned. at least a bit less personal if it seems futile. 
			<br><br>
			i also edited it to remove the mention of someone about whom it's currently painful for me to think about and i didn't want to see it on my own website. is this useful to share? it feels honest and real. i might write more about these feelings.

		<h3>25/08/2024 - a few random questions about games and stray thoughts</h3>
		<p>
			is it low brow to say a game is not fun?
			<br><br>
			everytime i feel about to state that, i feel years of discourse and reading and talking about games that don't need to be fun (i should know i've made a bunch), about "meeting games on their own terms", and about challenging my notions of what is fun for me and other people. i often feel scared about stating this in certain spaces so as not to seem immature/pedantic/mean/stupid. but sometimes i just don't derive any pleasure from something, and i don't really like that.
			<br>
			what made me think of this is some of droqen's droqever games.  i don't rly like them. but i feel like i should to be smart/interesting/cool.
			<br><br>
			i've been writing a draft of a syllabus for a "can games change the world?" class. this has given me the space to formulate a lot of thoughts and questions. one of them that just came up is why do games make you fight evil people (CEOs, politicians, etc.)? is the author trying to get you to feel empowered to defeat them IRL, or is it just shorthand to get you to feel invested in the story? if the former, does it ever work? can we prove it?
			<br>
			i guess the answers to these might be obvious, and a lot of people have written a lot about this i'm sure. but still sometimes i write a villain like this and i rarely stop to think "why do i do this?". maybe it's all virtue signalling. i'd like to hope it's not.
			<br><br>
			saving this document and refreshing the web page to see it in the font and everything feels very satisfying.
			<br><br>
			"b-games" get so much mileage from the player's willingness to keep going just to "see if anything happens if i do this for long enough/if i do this seemingly impossible or not-planned-for thing". when that gets rewarded, it is wonderful. when the player gives up before seeing the surprise, it is unfortunate. when the player goes through the thing and finds nothing new, it is disappointing. the classic "is there anything after this" problem.
			<br>
			i guess this is born from necessity/small authors not having the resources to make things always clear and intuitive as is expected because of AAA/indie-A standards. i guess this also transformed into intentional aesthetic decisions based on an appreciation of the moment of discovery over anything else and an appreciation of the hostile/cold/unresponsive/unfeeling. sometimes it's too much for me but sometimes it's wonderful. the difference can depend on 10 more seconds of gameplay that i decided to give the game when i might've given up. if my friend made the game, i may or may not be willing to give it more lenience.
			<br><br>
			i have noticed when i write freely i use so many ///. this is a sign of my appreciation of the multiple nature of every living/non-living thing.

		<h3>10/06/2024 - beginning</h3>
		<p>
			Thought I'd start laying some thoughts down after being inspired by <a href="https://billwurtz.com/">bill wurtz</a> and <a href="https://newforum.droqen.com/?hidden=true/">droqen</a> (maybe I should also have my own forum? That feels like a step a bit too far in terms of efforts tbh but I do really love the idea).
			<br><br>
			Why do it this way (publically)?  To be honest there's a somewhat perverse/exhibitionist pleasure about the thought of having my personal thoughts out in the open like this (but also with some degree of effort to find by tucking it away in my website) which would I think motivate me to write more and more often (I've picked up journaling on and off over the years and it just never takes... I'll probably drop this eventually too but I think that's an OK thing to happen.) It'd be a bit similar to the kind of things I got out of the <a href="https://hatimb00.itch.io/the-game-of-theseus">the game of theseus</a> (which I should get back into making this summer) but without the constraint of you know having an arc and making it like fictionalized. I also really enjoy being able to access some of my favorites artists' personal writings (see above) and maybe some other people who like my work can find this too and get some value out of it.
			<br><br>
			Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format because US hegemony etc etc.
			<br><br>
			Things to discuss later: my plans for this summer, a new direction for the game of theseus, thesis thoughts, loneliness and crushes, hunger, my relationship with the US, community, (not) being a digital nomad, NYC, why I don't like playing video games.
			<br><br>
			EDIT (25/08/24): I have censored part of this update because it reminded me too much of a specific person and that embarasses me.
