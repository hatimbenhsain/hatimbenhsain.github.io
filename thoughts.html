		<h3>10/06/2024 - beginning</h3>
		<p>
			Thought I'd start laying some thoughts down after being inspired by <a href="https://billwurtz.com/">bill wurtz</a>, <a href="https://gurngroup.org/">gurn group</a> and <a href="https://newforum.droqen.com/?hidden=true/">droqen</a> (maybe I should also have my own forum? That feels like a step a bit too far in terms of efforts tbh but I do really love the idea).
			<br><br>
			Why do it this way (publically)?  To be honest there's a somewhat perverse/exhibitionist pleasure about the thought of having my personal thoughts out in the open like this (but also with some degree of effort to find by tucking it away in my website) which would I think motivate me to write more and more often (I've picked up journaling on and off over the years and it just never takes... I'll probably drop this eventually too but I think that's an OK thing to happen.) It'd be a bit similar to the kind of things I got out of the <a href="https://hatimb00.itch.io/the-game-of-theseus">the game of theseus</a> (which I should get back into making this summer) but without the constraint of you know having an arc and making it like fictionalized. I also really enjoy being able to access some of my favorites artists' personal writings (see above) and maybe some other people who like my work can find this too and get some value out of it.
			<br><br>
			Dates are in DD/MM/YYYY format because US hegemony etc etc.
			<br><br>
			Things to discuss later: my plans for this summer, a new direction for the game of theseus, thesis thoughts, loneliness and crushes, hunger, my relationship with the US, community, (not) being a digital nomad, NYC, why I don't like playing video games.
