            CAN I BRING A +1: sure! unless it's someone i hate.
            <br><br>
            WHY IS THIS NOT A PARTIFUL: because of <a href="https://nyc-noise.com/drone-party/">this</a> (in short, partiful founders have tight links with palantir. it's also a cpu killer for no reason). in the future, i suggest that you do not use partiful anymore (that could be your gift :) ). ideally i'd also rather not use google sheets and would love to decouple from google but i haven't figured out an easy alternative yet (and i use google for so much stuff vs partiful is easy to give up)
            <br><br>
            we're having some issues with boshi's place currently hence the location tbd so check back here closer to the date about location!
            <br><br>
            for the larp, you don't have to prepare anything but the idea is that we're gonna pretend it's a game launch party :)
            <br><br>
            for the potluck i'm putting some food items that i'd love to be there for anyone to claim by putting your name there hehe but feel free to add whatever you'd rather bring
            <br><br>
            also my actual birthday is february 7!
