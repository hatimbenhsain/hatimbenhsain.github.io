			<p> Go Out Abu Dhabi is an Abu Dhabi street food-themed comics online delivery system. <br><br>
				The idea came about after I observed that many - if not most of - NYUAD students know very little about the city where they live, and when they do take the time to get out of the campus bubble, they hardly ever go beyong the malls. With my comics, I do not wish to tell people where to go; rather, I want to tell a story, intrigue, and ultimately push readers to go out, experience, and explore Abu Dhabi on their own. And while the project was originally intended for NYUAD students, I hope that they can also eventually be experience by other Abu Dhabi residents as well.<br><br>
				This menu is my final project for the class Temporary Experts taught by Marina Zurkrow, but it is also inspired from what I've learnt in the class Street Food taught by Deepak Unnikrishnan.<br><br>
