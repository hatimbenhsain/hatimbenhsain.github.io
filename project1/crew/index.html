					<p class='bio' id='gabyB'>One of the pioneers in her field, Gaby Anne is a renowned multi-awarded film director. After graduating from the Djibouti School of Film, she made her first feature  movie, 'Blade of Search' (2005), which earned her the Oscar of Best Silent Film, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Original Song. Today, after having disappeared for more than 10 years in hermitage in the tundras of Northern Russia, she comes back with a new sure-to-be hit, Closure.</p>
					<p class='bio' id='robertB'>A veteran of the film industry but also a man of mysteries, Robert is known for having acted in more that 100 movies without ever attending a film premiere. He achieved fame in 1984 in his iconic Mickey Mouse Live-Action role, and he has not left the screen ever since. Despite that, not a single papparazzi has been able to take a picture of him outside of a film set. Conspiracists believe him to be a government creation.</p>
					<p class='bio' id='saraB'>The young princess heiress of Egypt, Sara enters the film industry for the first time with her lead role in Closure. After having lead a succesful multi-international music career with her band "Sara and Some Other Dudes", she grew bored of the rockstar-lifestyle and decided - to our great pleasure - to try out her hand at acting. She's also the co-founder of many charity organizations for the fight against premature balding.</p>
